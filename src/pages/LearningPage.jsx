            So I will briefly tell you how my programming career began. I used
            to play so many computer games until I realised that I should be
            doing something useful with my life. As a gamer I decided that I
            should do something that is associated with computers. That is when
            I discovered programming. I was 21. I began my learning journey by
            watching YouTube tutorials and solving simple coding challenges and
            built my way up from there.

            My first actual project I worked on was an Internet Gaming Cafe
            Windows application with C/C++ Windows API as a freelancer. The most
            complicated part was setting up a database. I first set it up by
            using the MySQL library for C++ then decided that creating my own
            database using CSV files was the way to go. I store all the
            information in a local CSV file and fetch required information from
            there. Coding a functional scrollbar from scratch was tough as well.
            Needless to say, this was a great learning experience and assisted
            in improving my C/C++ skills and understanding how Windows
            applications work behind the scenes.

            For my next project I built a web application for a fishing trip

            and like. The logic behind this idea was pretty complicated because
            it was my first time ever working with Firebase. The website is not

            feed it commands and it parses them and executes them accordingly.
            <br />

            Minishell was a huge project and it took us 2 months to complete.

            split up the work. I was working on execution and parsing and she
            worked on built-in commands. <br /> <br />A challenging issue I
            faced when working on my part was trying to execute commands with
            piping functionality. I looked up Stackoverflow, read the pipe
            manual but still couldn't figure out why the shell just gets stuck
            when piping. Taking advantage of the peer-to-peer system in 42 I
            asked a few students and one of them said that I might not be
            waiting for the child process to finish. I tried that but to no
            avail until someone else told me that I should close the pipes after
            using them. So I tried that and voila it worked!
            <br />
            <br />
            Another issue we both faced was related to built-in commands. She
            was testing the exit command she wrote and asked me to take a look.
            So then we both noticed that it does not work when passing a maximum
            unsigned long as an argument to exit. We solved it by using a quick
            hacky way where in our custom atoi we check that the size of the
            string digits that we want to convert to integer is not more than
            19. It was great working with a brilliant student like Anastasia, I
            learnt so much from her and would love to work with her again in the
            near future.

          <Typography variant="h5">42's CPP Module Project</Typography>

            My next school project was CPP Module. It was a solo project. This
            project teaches you the fundamentals of C++ programming language and
            object-oriented programming.
            <br />
            <br />
            Object-oriented programming is pretty complicated and I did face a
            couple of challenges. In one tricky exercise you had to implement
            polymorphism so I had one tiny logical error where it was not
            printing the function of the derived class. I did some research and
            thought maybe I should make the function in the base class virtual
            and luckily enough I was right.
            <br />
            <br />
            Even though object-oriented programming is rather intricate, it gets
            simpler as I proceeded through my learning journey. You will know
            what I mean when we get to the last project.

            facing north has its own texture and a wall facing west has its own
            texture and so on. This problem was required by the project's
            subject but it was not explained in these tutorials. So I decided
            that each texture to be drawn must be calculated either using the
            player's direction or the ray's direction. I asked my partner and he
            told me that most likely it could be calculated using the ray's
            direction. So we implemented it plus the usual bug fixes and Lo and
            behold he was right. This project taught me how teamwork and
            communication are keys to success. Luckily I had a very smart and
            kind partner. I wouldn't have done it without him.

            . But honestly even with all of that documentation this project was
            still relatively demanding.
            <br />
            <br />
            Previously I mentioned how C++ and object-oriented programming
            becomes easier. Not yet. Not until after this project. Once you
            complete this project you could pat yourself on the back and truely
            call yourself a C++ mini master. Yes, I said mini because C++ is
            extraordinarily vast and ft_containers is not enough to cover it
            all.
            <br />
            <br />I will begin by writing about the hardships that I faced in
            ft_containers. First, let me tell you about templates. Templates is
            a broad topic in and of itself. I had to peruse both of the
            documentations I mentioned to know how they did their magic. When I
            undertook this project I knew a few things here and there about
            templates. I knew that they could be used to pass arguments with
            different data types to a function at runtime thanks to my previous
            project CPP modules. But did you know that templates can also be
            used to detect whether a data type that you are passing to a
            function is an integer data type or not. Honestly it seemed
            complicated at first but once I got the hang of it, it became quite
            simple.
            <br />
            <br />
            Now I want to talk about binary search trees. Why binary search
            trees? Because they are an essenstial part of maps implementation.
            Map contains a pair of key and mapped value. So to locate a specific
            key in map you need an efficient algorithm. That is where binary
            trees comes into play. So I thought alright all I need to do is code
            a binary tree and I am done right? Well you see, it was not as
            simple as that. I implemented a binary tree with the help of{" "}

            binary tree in an ascending and descending order. So I sat and
            thought about it for a while. Let us say I have a binary tree such
            as this.
